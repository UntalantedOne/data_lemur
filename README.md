# data_lemur_sql_tasks

This repo is a short proof, both to myself and to anyone interested, that I can write sql queries, answer statistical questions and even do some ML.

However the will be some restrictions. I am commiting changes to this README file at around 17:30 Europe time, 2nd of March, 2023:
1. I will set a time constraint and see how many tasks (only free tasks) can be done in aeound 52 hours, untill midnight, March 5th
2. No reading of discussion shall be done. I am also not allowed to read the answers anywhere.
3. Each query shall be commented with explaining the way I was thinking
