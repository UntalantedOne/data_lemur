A fair die is rolled repeatedly until a number larger than 4 is observed.

What's the probability that it takes you 4 rolls to roll a number greater than 4?

Only 2 options out of 6 are accepted, so the probability of rolling the desired output is 1/3 and not desired is 2/3

So in the question the situation is that undesirable result was achieved 3 times in a row and then the desirable result was achieved.

As each dice roll is independent, the probability is:

(2/3)^3 * 1/3
